MyLake
=====

Hello world. This is the Mylake GIT hub. The goal is to maintain a up-to-date version of MyLake combining the features that are developed by the different groups. 

The current version of MyLake is : MYLAKE_2007

---MyLAKE---

Versions of MyLake (for exemple, MyLake FOKEMA, MyLake O2, MyLakeR, MyLake-sed) should be developed in one of the following way: 

1- In you own repository 
2- As a separate fork of MyLake 2007
3- As a branch on MyLake Current

The preferred approach is to evolve MyLake Current as a branch. Branching allows you to build new features or test out ideas without putting the main project at risk, and the project is relatively small and should allow this kind of collaborative work. If your branch  is ready to be merged and become the current version of MyLake, you should prepare a request after discussion we will merge with the main repository. 

---MyLAKE utilities---

All MyLake utilities and toolboxes are in individual folders maintained by their creator in the Utility repository. Please in include documentation. Inclusion of a specific utility or toolbox with the MyLAKE_Current distribution is up for debate in the Discussion board (TBA).
