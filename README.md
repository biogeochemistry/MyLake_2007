This is the Mylake GitHub page. See the wiki here for more info, as well as https://github.com/aemon-j/aquatic-ecosystem-model-library/wiki/MyLake for model description within the Aemon-J model library. 

MyLake is a 1D process-based lake model written in Matlab. It is developped as an open-source project, currently at the Norwegien Institute for Water Research-NIVA, the University of Helsinki (Finland), and Laval University (Canada). 

All versions are available upon request (see below), however only published version are publicly available.

MyLake v1.2.1 (2007)

This is the original version of MyLake. MyLake v1.2 simulates lake hydrodynamics, ice and snow thickness, photon budget, phosphorus speciation, algual dynamics (2 pools) and sediment-water interactions (box model).
