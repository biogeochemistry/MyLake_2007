This is the Mylake GitHub page. See the wiki for litterature review and user manual.
MyLake is a 1D process-based lake model written in Matlab. It is developped as an open-source project, currently at the Norwegien Institute for Water Research-NIVA, the University of Helsinki (Finland), and Laval University (Canada). 

All versions are available upon request (see below), however only published version are publicly available.

MyLake v1.2.1 (2007)

This is the original version of MyLake. MyLake v1.2 simulates lake hydrodynamics, ice, photon budget, phosphorus speciation, algual dynamics (2 pools) and sediment-water interactions (box model). 

Publication: Saloranta, T. M.; Andersen, T., MyLake - A multi-year lake simulation model code suitable for uncertainty and sensitivity analysis simulations. Ecol. Model. 2007, 207 (1), 45-60. Contact: tus@nve.no

The manual is available online here : https://niva.brage.unit.no/niva-xmlui/handle/11250/212445

See the Wiki for get-going sheets. Get the code in the "master" branch.

MyLake FOKEMA (2014)

This version adds support for organic matter degradation and improves the photo-bleaching routine.

MyLake O (2015)

This version refines DOC (3 pools), DIC equilibria, O2 dynamics, microbial metabolicm and improved sediment-water interactions (with full diagenetic model for sediment including OM, P, N, C, Fe, Mn, Al, H+)
