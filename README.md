This is the Mylake GIT hub. Check out the wiki for litterature review and user manual.
MyLake is an open-source 1D process-based ake model written in Matlab and developped at the Norwegien Institute for Water Research. 
***
The current public version of MyLake is : MYLAKE v1.2(2007) 
This version simulates lake hydrodynamics, ice, photon budget, phosphorus speciation, algual dynamics (2 pools) and sediment-water interactions (box model)

***
The development version of MyLake is : MYLAKE DOCOMO (2015)
This version adds DOC (3 pools), DIC equilibria, O2 dynamics, microbial metabolicm and improved sediment-water interactions (full diagenetic model with P, N, C, Fe, Mn, Al, H+)
